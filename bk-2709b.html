    <title>BK2709b Review</title>
    <description>Â£100 Multimeter. The BK Precision 2709b is an accurate, mid tier multimeter with all the features you would expect in this price range. The case quality isn't great and the stand needs improvement.</description>

    <h4>Build Quality</h4>
    As I've mentioned, the 2709B definitely isn't a rugged meter for site work. It has a thin rubberised overmould which makes it pleasant to hold, but the stand leaves a lot to be desired. I first had issues with it within the first month of owning it. The small plastic lugs on the battery door that the stand pivots on are very poor. There is no hard end stop for the stand so it's easy to open it too far and damage the lugs. I managed to sheer off one of the lugs on my unit but BK Precision's support department sent me a replacement free of charge! Upon fitting this new battery cover and stand it was instantly apparent that the stand was simply badly designed. It doesn't feel solid and doesn't click closed properly. So I've taped it closed to keep it safe for occasional use.

    <h4>Fuses</h4>
    The low current range fuse (F1) is a 0.5A 500V, fast acting ceramic fuse with dimensions 6.35x32mm.
    The 10A range fuse (F2) is 10A/600V and also  a fast blow ceramic fuse in a 6.35x25.4mm form factor which happens to be the same as in the BS1362 three pin plug.
