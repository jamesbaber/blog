<h3>Issues</h3>
<p>
As I've mentioned, the 2709B definately isn't a rugged meter for site work.
It has a thin rubberised overmould which makes it pleasant to hold, but the stand leaves a lot to be desired.
I first had issues with it within the first month of owning it. The small plastic lugs on the battery door that the stand pivots on are very poor.
There is no hard end stop for the stand so it's easy to open it too far and damage the lugs. I managed to sheer off one of the lugs on my unit
but <a href="http://www.bkprecision.com/support.html">BK Precision's support department</a> sent me a replacement free of charge!
Upon fitting this new battery cover and stand it was instantly apparent that the stand was simply badly designed.
It doesn't feel solid and doesn't click closed properly. So I've taped it closed to keep it safe for occasional use.

<h3>Fuses</h3>
<p>
Replace F1 0.5A/500V, fast acting ceramic fuse, 6.35x32mm.
Replace F2 10A/600V, fast acting ceramic fuse, 6.35x25.4mm.
